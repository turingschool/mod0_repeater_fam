one thing I've noticed is that I end up getting a little bit perfectionist and spend a lot more time than I probably should on any given project. I need to learn that once I've demonstrated the capability, there is no reason to keep working at it.

Another big thing for me is that I need to spend as much time as possible on the projects, but I also need to know when to take breaks to make the most of my time spent studying and make the work more sustainable.
