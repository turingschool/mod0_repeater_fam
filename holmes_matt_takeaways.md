## Matt's Takeaways from Mod 0 (second round) ##
- By far the biggest win for me in coming back into Mod 0 is how much more comfortable I feel with nearly everything being presented. I felt so constantly behind before in both Mod 0 and Mod 1, so it's a nice confidence-builder to finally find the zone where I achieved some competence.
- Ah-ha moments in Mod 0... I am not sure that I would conceptualize the connections I've made as anything that dramatic, but one really cool connection is that my ability to pseudocode is so much better now that I have some familiarity with actual code. It helps me know the eventual target.
- Changes in my approach include the fact that I'm not working right now as I was in my previous Mod 0. I am actually on a LOA to deal with some pressing needs in my personal life, so it's not that I'm dedicating my full attention to Mod 0, but it is nice to be able schedule both class and work time on a more as-needed basis as opposed to an as-possible basis.
