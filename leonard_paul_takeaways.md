1) This one is actually kind of funny.  I don't know how, but I completely missed the memo last time about making our commit messages imperative.  Big aha moment when I realized what the critiques of my hw last time actually meant lol.
2) Since I am now essentially seeing the classes a second time, I know how beneficial it is to rewatch the sessions.
