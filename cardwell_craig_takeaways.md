The importance of scheduling on the calendar
It has been very beneficial reading the questions in Slack to get me thinking about what I learned in a way to apply it to help someone
A big aha moment has been realizing how much on the concepts I missed in class because I was so focused on simply listening
I have been able to connect the tools like text editor the terminal git and github more effectively instead of each as a silo
Proactive partnering and communication has been very helpful
Making more meaningful commit messages is something I am working to apply
Taking full advantage of the homework assignments to get better and anchor concepts
